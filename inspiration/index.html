        <h2>these are some creatives that inspire me</h2>
        <br>
            <a href="https://www.maisonmargiela.com/en-us/"><h3><b>Martin Margiela</b></h3></a>
                 <h4>Margiela really speaks to me as a designer
                    because he was known for deconstructing and reinventing 
                    classic silhouettes along with going against the exclusivity
                    of high fashion. His brand also has very unique 
                    identifiers that they continue to use as motifs even after 
                    Margiela's retirement.</h4>

            <a href="https://laluneofficial.com/"><h3><b>Quách Đắc Thắng</b></h3></a>
                <h4>Thắng is a designer that inspires me because he is a
                    small designer from Vietnam that is creating spectacular
                    pieces without a large following. He also has a great blend
                    of trendy ready to wear that is accessible to the everyday
                    consumer while also having a catalog of insane made to order
                    couture.</h4>

            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gremlita/featured"><h3><b>Mina Le</b></h3></a>
                <h4>Mina Le is my favorite youtube video essayist. She
                    creates content delving into pop culture phenomena and
                    fashion trends through history. I adore her aesthetic,
                    and even though she is so clearly inspired by 1920s fashion,
                    her content is still modern and enjoyable for the average 
                    consumer.</h4>
